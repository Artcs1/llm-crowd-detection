The distances are calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nAfter computing all pairwise distances, I analyze their distribution. The goal is to identify a reasonable threshold that separates close individuals from distant ones. A common approach is to use a percentile (e.g., 10th or 20th) of the distances as a threshold, which captures the "close" interactions while avoiding merging distant individuals.\n\nThe pairwise distances show a clear gap: most distances are large (e.g., >5 units), but a few are very small (e.g., <0.5 units). The 10th percentile of the distances is approximately 0.45 units. Using this as a threshold helps isolate tightly grouped clusters.\n\nI then apply a clustering algorithm (connected components based on distance < threshold) to group people. People are connected if their distance is below 0.45. This results in the following groups:\n\n- Group 1: Persons 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 — all within ~0.5 units of each other in the (-2.5, 1.5, 6.5) region.\n- Group 2: Persons 2, 4, 10, 15 — all near (0, 1.2, 3.2), with distances < 0.45.\n- Group 3: Persons 3, 6 — slightly farther apart (~3.5 units), but no others nearby; however, they are not close to anyone else, so they remain isolated.\n- Group 4: Persons 8, 11, 16 — in the (2.5, 4.2, 23) region, with mutual distances < 0.45.\n- Group 5: Persons 12, 18, 19, 21, 20, 13 — in a line from (21,4.5,26) to (37,5.5,36), but distances between consecutive points are ~2–4 units, so they are not close. However, upon closer inspection, no two of them are within 0.45, so they remain isolated.\n\nWait — upon re-evaluating, the distances between 12, 18, 19, 21, 20, 13 are all above 0.45. For example:\n- 12 to 18: ~2.5 units\n- 18 to 19: ~2.6 units\n- 19 to 21: ~2.4 units\n- 21 to 20: ~2.8 units\n- 20 to 13: ~11 units\n\nSo none are close. Therefore, they are all isolated.\n\nBut wait — let\'s double-check the cluster around 3 and 6:\n- Person 3: (9.57, 2.00, 10.79)\n- Person 6: (9.17, 2.60, 13.65)\n- Distance: √[(0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (2.86)^2] ≈ √[0.16 + 0.36 + 8.18] ≈ √8.7 ≈ 2.95 — too far.\n\nSo 3 and 6 are not close.\n\nThus, only the clusters with very small distances are valid.\n\nFinal clusters:\n- Group 1: 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 — all within ~0.5 units\n- Group 2: 2, 4, 10, 15 — all within ~0.4 units\n- All others (3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21) are isolated (no one within 0.45 units)\n\nBut wait — let\'s verify 8, 11, 16:\n- 8: (3.61, 4.22, 23.33)\n- 11: (2.15, 3.89, 22.23) → distance: √[(1.46)^2 + (0.33)^2 + (1.1)^2] ≈ √[2.13 + 0.11 + 1.21] ≈ √3.45 ≈ 1.86 — too far\n- 16: (2.52, 4.19, 23.16) → distance to 11: √[(0.37)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.99)^2] ≈ √[0.14 + 0.09 + 0.98] ≈ √1.21 ≈ 1.1 — still > 0.45\n- 16 to 8: √[(1.09)^2 + (0.03)^2 + (0.17)^2] ≈ √[1.19 + 0 + 0.03] ≈ √1.22 ≈ 1.1 — still > 0.45\n\nSo no group among 8,11,16.\n\nNow, check if 3 and 6 are close to anyone? No.\n\nBut wait — person 24: (-0.757, 1.195, 6.440) — very close to person 9: (-0.7575, 1.1875, 6.4425) → distance ≈ √[0.0005^2 + 0.0075^2 + 0.0025^2] ≈ √[0.00000025 + 0.00005625 + 0.00000625] ≈ √0.00006275 ≈ 0.0079 — extremely close.\n\nBut person 9 is not in the list of 1,5,7,14,17,24? Wait — person 9 is in the input.\n\nLet me recheck the list:\n\n- Person 9: (-0.7575, 1.1875, 6.4425)\n- Person 24: (-0.7572, 1.1945, 6.4401) → distance ≈ 0.0079 — very close\n\nBut person 9 is not in the initial group with 1,5,7,14,17,24? Let\'s check person 1: (-2.50, 1.53, 6.36)\n\nDistance from 1 to 9: √[(-2.50 + 0.7575)^2 + (1.53 - 1.1875)^2 + (6.36 - 6.4425)^2] ≈ √[(-1.7425)^2 + (0.3425)^2 + (-0.0825)^2] ≈ √[3.036 + 0.117 + 0.0068] ≈ √3.16 ≈ 1.78 — too far.\n\nBut person 9 is very close to person 24.

The distances are calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nAfter computing all pairwise distances, I analyze their distribution. The goal is to identify a reasonable threshold that separates close individuals from distant ones. A common approach is to use a percentile (e.g., 10th or 20th) of the distances as a threshold, which captures the "close" interactions while avoiding merging distant individuals.\n\nThe pairwise distances show a clear gap: most distances are large (e.g., >5 units), but a few are very small (e.g., <0.5 units). The 10th percentile of the distances is approximately 0.45 units. Using this as a threshold helps isolate tightly grouped clusters.\n\nI then apply a clustering algorithm (connected components based on distance < threshold) to group people. People are connected if their distance is below 0.45. This results in the following groups:\n\n- Group 1: Persons 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 — all within ~0.5 units of each other in the (-2.5, 1.5, 6.5) region.\n- Group 2: Persons 2, 4, 10, 15 — all near (0, 1.2, 3.2), with distances < 0.45.\n- Group 3: Persons 3, 6 — slightly farther apart (~3.5 units), but no others nearby; however, they are not close to anyone else, so they remain isolated.\n- Group 4: Persons 8, 11, 16 — in the (2.5, 4.2, 23) region, with mutual distances < 0.45.\n- Group 5: Persons 12, 18, 19, 21, 20, 13 — in a line from (21,4.5,26) to (37,5.5,36), but distances between consecutive points are ~2–4 units, so they are not close. However, upon closer inspection, no two of them are within 0.45, so they remain isolated.\n\nWait — upon re-evaluating, the distances between 12, 18, 19, 21, 20, 13 are all above 0.45. For example:\n- 12 to 18: ~2.5 units\n- 18 to 19: ~2.6 units\n- 19 to 21: ~2.4 units\n- 21 to 20: ~2.8 units\n- 20 to 13: ~11 units\n\nSo none are close. Therefore, they are all isolated.\n\nBut wait — let\'s double-check the cluster around 3 and 6:\n- Person 3: (9.57, 2.00, 10.79)\n- Person 6: (9.17, 2.60, 13.65)\n- Distance: √[(0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (2.86)^2] ≈ √[0.16 + 0.36 + 8.18] ≈ √8.7 ≈ 2.95 — too far.\n\nSo 3 and 6 are not close.\n\nThus, only the clusters with very small distances are valid.\n\nFinal clusters:\n- Group 1: 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 — all within ~0.5 units\n- Group 2: 2, 4, 10, 15 — all within ~0.4 units\n- All others (3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21) are isolated (no one within 0.45 units)\n\nBut wait — let\'s verify 8, 11, 16:\n- 8: (3.61, 4.22, 23.33)\n- 11: (2.15, 3.89, 22.23) → distance: √[(1.46)^2 + (0.33)^2 + (1.1)^2] ≈ √[2.13 + 0.11 + 1.21] ≈ √3.45 ≈ 1.86 — too far\n- 16: (2.52, 4.19, 23.16) → distance to 11: √[(0.37)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.99)^2] ≈ √[0.14 + 0.09 + 0.98] ≈ √1.21 ≈ 1.1 — still > 0.45\n- 16 to 8: √[(1.09)^2 + (0.03)^2 + (0.17)^2] ≈ √[1.19 + 0 + 0.03] ≈ √1.22 ≈ 1.1 — still > 0.45\n\nSo no group among 8,11,16.\n\nNow, check if 3 and 6 are close to anyone?

So they are a group of two.\n\nBut earlier I thought 1,5,7,14,17 were close — let\'s verify:\n\n- Person 1: (-2.504, 1.529, 6.363)\n- Person 5: (-1.830, 1.584, 6.593) → distance: √[(-0.674)^2 + (-0.055)^2 + (-0.23)^2] ≈ √[0.454 + 0.003 + 0.053] ≈ √0.51 ≈ 0.71 — > 0.45\n- Person 7: (-1.758, 1.222, 7.844) → distance to 5: √[(-0.072)^2 + (-0.362)^2 + (-1.251)^2] ≈ √[0.005 + 0.131 + 1.565] ≈ √1.7 → 1.3 — too far\n\nSo 1 and 5 are not close.\n\nWait — this suggests my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nLet’s compute all pairwise distances for the people near (-1.7, 1.2, 7.8) and (-0.75, 1.2, 6.4):\n\nList of people in that area:\n- 1: (-2.504, 1.529, 6.363)\n- 5: (-1.830, 1.584, 6.593)\n- 7: (-1.758, 1.222, 7.844)\n- 14: (-1.771, 1.243, 7.859)\n- 17: (-1.765, 1.221, 7.834)\n- 24: (-0.757, 1.195, 6.440)\n- 9: (-0.7575, 1.1875, 6.4425)\n\nNow compute distances:\n\nBetween 7,14,17:\n- 7 to 14: √[(-0.013)^2 + (-0.021)^2 + (-0.015)^2] ≈ √[0.00017 + 0.00044 + 0.00022] ≈ √0.00083 ≈ 0.029 — very close\n- 7 to 17: √[(-0.007)^2 + (0.001)^2 + (0.010)^2] ≈ √[0.00005 + 0.000001 + 0.0001] ≈ √0.00015 ≈ 0.012 — very close\n- 14 to 17: √[(-0.006)^2 + (-0.022)^2 + (0.025)^2] ≈ √[0.000036 + 0.000484 + 0.000625] ≈ √0.001145 ≈ 0.034 — very close\n\nSo 7,14,17 form a tight cluster.\n\nNow person 5: (-1.830, 1.584, 6.593)\n- to 7: √[(-0.072)^2 + (-0.362)^2 + (-1.251)^2] ≈ √[0.005 + 0.131 + 1.565] ≈ √1.7 → 1.3 — too far\n- to 14: similar — too far\n\nPerson 1: (-2.504, 1.529, 6.363)\n- to 5: √[(-0.674)^2 + (-0.055)^2 + (-0.23)^2] ≈ √[0.454 + 0.003 + 0.053] ≈ √0.51 ≈ 0.71 — > 0.45\n\nPerson 24 and 9:\n- distance: ~0.0079 — very close\n\nPerson 24 to 17: √[(-1.008)^2 + (-0.034)^2 + (0.009)^2] ≈ √[1.016 + 0.001 + 0.00008] ≈ √1.017 ≈ 1.01 — too far\n\nSo 24 and 9 are a pair.\n\nNow check person 2: (0.0387, 1.192, 3.3627)\n- person 4: (-0.5113, 1.168, 3.0768) → distance: √[(0.55)^2 + (0.024)^2 + (0.286)^2] ≈ √[0.3025 + 0.000576 + 0.0818] ≈ √0.385 ≈ 0.62 — > 0.45\n- person 10: (-0.3796, 0.8064, 3.2287) → distance to 2: √[(0.418)^2 + (0.3856)^2 + (0.134)^2] ≈ √[0.175 + 0.148 + 0.018] ≈ √0.341 ≈ 0.58 — > 0.45\n- person 15: (-0.7721, 0.9187, 3.2715) → distance to 2: √[(0.8108)^2 + (0.2733)^2 + (0.0912)^2] ≈ √[0.657 + 0.0747 + 0.0083] ≈ √0.74 → 0.86 — too far\n\nSo no cluster among 2,4,10,15.\n\nBut person 10 and 15: distance: √[(-0.3925)^2 + (0.1123)^2 + (0.043)^2] ≈ √[0.154 + 0.0126 + 0.00185] ≈ √0.168 ≈ 0.41 — < 0.45!
