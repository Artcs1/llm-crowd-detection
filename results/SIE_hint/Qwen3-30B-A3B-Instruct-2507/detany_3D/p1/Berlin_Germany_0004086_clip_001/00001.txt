The Euclidean distance between two points (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂) is given by:\n\n√[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²]\n\nAfter computing all pairwise distances, I analyze the distribution of these distances to determine a reasonable threshold. The goal is to identify clusters of people who are close to each other in space, while avoiding merging distant individuals.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are clustered near x ≈ -2 to 0, y ≈ 1.2 to 1.8, z ≈ 7 to 12 — this suggests a tight group.\n- People 3, 6, 9, 13, 14, 17 are spread out but with some proximity in z (23–32), but their x and y values are more dispersed.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 are in a high z region (40–56), with x and y increasing together — suggesting another cluster.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are all within ~2.5 units in x, y, and z — forming a dense cluster.\n- People 3, 6, 9, 13, 14, 17: while some are close (e.g., 3 and 6 are ~11.2 units apart), others are far (e.g., 3 to 14 is ~15 units), and no strong connectivity.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21: these are spread over x=3 to 28, y=3.6 to 4.1, z=40 to 56. The distances between consecutive ones (e.g., 18–19–20–21) are small (~1–3 units), suggesting a chain-like group.\n\nUsing a threshold of 3.0 units (a reasonable choice based on the distribution of small distances), I apply a connected components algorithm:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are all within 3.0 units of at least one other in the group — forming one cluster.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21: distances between 18–19 (~0.05), 19–20 (~3.3), 20–21 (~2.5), 16–18 (~2.5), 11–16 (~3.2), 8–11 (~3.3) — some are just over 3.0, but 11–16 is 3.2, which is borderline. However, 16–18 is ~2.5, 18–19 ~0.05, 19–20 ~3.3, 20–21 ~2.5 — so 18–19–20–21 are tightly connected, and 16 is close to 18, 11 to 16, 8 to 11 — forming a chain. But 8 to 11 is ~3.3 > 3.0, so if we strictly use 3.0, they may not connect.\n\nRe-evaluating: the distance between 8 and 11 is ~3.3, which exceeds 3.0. But 11 to 16 is ~3.2, also over. So perhaps the chain breaks.\n\nBut let's compute exact distances:\n- 18 to 19: √[(20.3419 - 20.2973)² + (3.6801 - 3.6601)² + (46.8929 - 49.5933)²] ≈ √[0.0446² + 0.02² + (-2.7004)²] ≈ √[0.002 + 0.0004 + 7.292] ≈ √7.294 ≈ 2.70 → < 3.0 → connected.\n- 19 to 20: √[(20.2973 - 28.322)² + (3.6601 - 4.0585)² + (49.5933 - 52.9877)²] ≈ √[(-8.0247)² + (-0.3984)² + (-3.3944)²] ≈ √[64.396 + 0.159 + 11.522] ≈ √76.077 ≈ 8.72 → too far.\n- 16 to 18: √[(1.7446 - 20.3419)² + (3.4813 - 3.6801)² + (40.9732 - 46.8929)²] ≈ √[(-18.5973)² + (-0.1988)² + (-5.9197)²] ≈ √[345.86 + 0.0395 + 35.04] ≈ √380.94 ≈ 19.5 → too far.\n\nSo 18–19 are close, but 19–20 is far. Similarly, 16–18 is far. So only 18–19 are close. But 18 and 19 are within 3.0 of each other, but no others are.\n\nWait — 18 and 19 are only 2.7 apart — so they form a pair. But 20 is far from 19. Similarly, 16 is far from 18. 11 is far from 16. 8 is far from 11.\n\nSo only 18 and 19 are within 3.0 of each other? Let's check 16 and 18 again: 19.5 — no. 11 and 16: √[(1.7446 - 1.4896)² + (3.4813 - 3.3521)² + (40.9732 - 40.5143)²] ≈ √[0.255² + 0.129² + 0.4589²] ≈ √[0.065 + 0.0166 + 0.2105] ≈ √0.292 ≈ 0.54 → very close! So 11 and 16 are only 0.54 apart.\n\nSimilarly, 16 and 18: √[(20.3419 - 1.7446)² + (3.6801 - 3.4813)² + (46.8929 - 40.9732)²] ≈ √[18.5973² + 0.1988² + 5.9197²] ≈ √[345.86 + 0.0395 + 35.04] ≈ √380.94 ≈ 19.5 — still too far.\n\nBut 11 and 16 are 0.54 apart — so they are connected.\n\nNow 8 and 11: √[(3.2441 - 1.4896)² + (3.9729 - 3.3521)² + (47.8249 - 40.5143)²] ≈ √[1.7545² + 0.6208² + 7.3106²] ≈ √[3.078 + 0.385 + 53.44] ≈ √56.9 ≈ 7.54 — too far.\n\nSo 11 and 16 are connected (0.54), but 16 and 18 are not (19.5), so 16 is only connected to 11.\n\nSimilarly, 18 and 19: 2.7 apart — connected.\n\nSo we have:\n- Group A: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 (all close to each other, < 3.0)\n- Group B: 11, 16 (connected)\n- Group C: 18, 19 (connected)\n- Others: 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 — all isolated (no one within 3.0 of them)\n\nWait — let's check if 3 and 6 are close: √[(9.6816 - 10.9097)² + (2.4936 - 2.0996)² + (28.0288 - 23.6373)²] ≈ √[(-1.2281)² + (0.394)² + (4.3915)²] ≈ √[1.508 + 0.155 + 19.285] ≈ √20.95 ≈ 4.58 — > 3.0\n\nSimilarly, 6 and 9: √[(9.6816 - (-1.516))² + (2.4936 - 1.745)² + (28.0288 - 20.2858)²] ≈ √[11.1976² + 0.7486² + 7.743²] ≈ √[125.39 + 0.56 + 59.95] ≈ √185.9 ≈ 13.64 — far\n\nSo no connections.\n\nNow check 14 and 17: both near x=-4.2, y≈2.2–2.3, z≈31–32.5\n- 14: (-4.1373, 2.2348, 31.1107)\n- 17: (-4.2470, 2.2696, 32.1153)\n- Distance: √[(-0.1097)² + (0.0348)² + (1.0046)²] ≈ √[0.012 + 0.0012 + 1.009] ≈ √1.022 ≈ 1.01 — < 3.0 → connected.\n\nSo 14 and 17 are close.\n\nSimilarly, 7: (-4.2679, 2.3253, 32.4281) — compare to 14: √[(-4.2679 +4.1373)² + (2.3253 - 2.2348)² + (32.4281 - 31.1107)²] ≈ √[(-0.1306)² + (0.0905)² + (1.3174)²] ≈ √[0.017 + 0.0082 + 1.735] ≈ √1.76 ≈ 1.33 — < 3.0 → connected to 14.\n\nSimilarly, 17: √[(-4.2679 +4.2470)² + (2.3253 - 2.2696)² + (32.4281 - 32.1153)²] ≈ √[(-0.0209)² + (0.0557)² + (0.3128)²] ≈ √[0.0004 + 0.0031 + 0.0978] ≈ √0.1013 ≈ 0.32 — very close.\n\nSo 7, 14, 17 are all within 3.0 of each other — form a group.\n\nSimilarly, 3 and 6: 4.58 — too far.\n\nNow check 12: (20.2941, 3.7334, 50.3484) — compare to 18: (20.3419, 3.6801, 46.8929) → √[(0.0478)² + (-0.0533)² + (-3.4555)²] ≈ √[0.0023 + 0.0028 + 11.94] ≈ √11.95 ≈ 3.46 — > 3.0 → not connected.\n\nSimilarly, 19: (20.2973, 3.6601, 49.5933) — to 18: 2.7 → connected, but 19 to 12: √[(20.2973 - 20.2941)² + (3.6601 - 3.7334)² + (49.5933 - 50.3484)²] ≈ √[0.0032² + (-0.0733)² + (-0.7551)²] ≈ √[0.00001 + 0.0054 + 0.570] ≈ √0.575 ≈ 0.76 — < 3.0 → so 12 and 19 are close.\n\nWait — 12 and 19: 0.76 apart → connected.\n\nThen 19 and 18: 2.7 → connected.\n\nSo 12, 18, 19 form a group.\n\nSimilarly, 20: (28.322, 4.0585, 52.9877) — to 19: √[(28.322 - 20.2973)² + (4.0585 - 3.6601)² + (52.9877 - 49.5933)²] ≈ √[8.0247² + 0.3984² + 3.3944²] ≈ √[64.396 + 0.159 + 11.522] ≈ √76.077 ≈ 8.72 — too far.\n\n21: (15.6201, 4.0846, 55.9051) — to 19: √[(15.6201 - 20.2973)² + (4.0846 - 3.6601)² + (55.9051 - 49.5933)²] ≈

people based on their 3D positions, I first compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of people. The Euclidean distance between two points (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂) is given by:\n\n√[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²]\n\nAfter computing all pairwise distances, I analyze the distribution of these distances to determine a reasonable threshold. The goal is to identify clusters of people who are close to each other in space, while avoiding merging distant individuals.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are clustered near x ≈ -2 to 0, y ≈ 1.2 to 1.8, z ≈ 7 to 12 — this suggests a tight group.\n- People 3, 6, 9, 13, 14, 17 are spread out but with some proximity in z (23–32), but their x and y values are more dispersed.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 are in a high z region (40–56), with x and y increasing together — suggesting another cluster.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are all within ~2.5 units in x, y, and z — forming a dense cluster.\n- People 3, 6, 9, 13, 14, 17: while some are close (e.g., 3 and 6 are ~11.2 units apart), others are far (e.g., 3 to 14 is ~15 units), and no strong connectivity.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21: these are spread over x=3 to 28, y=3.6 to 4.1, z=40 to 56. The distances between consecutive ones (e.g., 18–19–20–21) are small (~1–3 units), suggesting a chain-like group.\n\nUsing a threshold of 3.0 units (a reasonable choice based on the distribution of small distances), I apply a connected components algorithm:\n- People 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 are all within 3.0 units of at least one other in the group — forming one cluster.\n- People 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21: distances between 18–19 (~0.05), 19–20 (~3.3), 20–21 (~2.5), 16–18 (~2.5), 11–16 (~3.2), 8–11 (~3.3) — some are just over 3.0, but 11–16 is 3.2, which is borderline. However, 16–18 is ~2.5, 18–19 ~0.05, 19–20 ~3.3, 20–21 ~2.5 — so 18–19–20–21 are tightly connected, and 16 is close to 18, 11 to 16, 8 to 11 — forming a chain. But 8 to 11 is ~3.3 > 3.0, so if we strictly use 3.0, they may not connect.\n\nRe-evaluating: the distance between 8 and 11 is ~3.3, which exceeds 3.0. But 11 to 16 is ~3.2, also over. So perhaps the chain breaks.\n\nBut let's compute exact distances:\n- 18 to 19: √[(20.3419 - 20.2973)² + (3.6801 - 3.6601)² + (46.8929 - 49.5933)²] ≈ √[0.0446² + 0.02² + (-2.7004)²] ≈ √[0.002 + 0.0004 + 7.292] ≈ √7.294 ≈ 2.70 → < 3.0 → connected.\n- 19 to 20: √[(20.2973 - 28.322)² + (3.6601 - 4.0585)² + (49.5933 - 52.9877)²] ≈ √[(-8.0247)² + (-0.3984)² + (-3.3944)²] ≈ √[64.396 + 0.159 + 11.522] ≈ √76.077 ≈ 8.72 → too far.\n- 16 to 18: √[(1.7446 - 20.3419)² + (3.4813 - 3.6801)² + (40.9732 - 46.8929)²] ≈ √[(-18.5973)² + (-0.1988)² + (-5.9197)²] ≈ √[345.86 + 0.0395 + 35.04] ≈ √380.94 ≈ 19.5 → too far.\n\nSo 18–19 are close, but 19–20 is far. Similarly, 16–18 is far. So only 18–19 are close. But 18 and 19 are within 3.0 of each other, but no others are.\n\nWait — 18 and 19 are only 2.7 apart — so they form a pair. But 20 is far from 19. Similarly, 16 is far from 18. 11 is far from 16. 8 is far from 11.\n\nSo only 18 and 19 are within 3.0 of each other? Let's check 16 and 18 again: 19.5 — no. 11 and 16: √[(1.7446 - 1.4896)² + (3.4813 - 3.3521)² + (40.9732 - 40.5143)²] ≈ √[0.255² + 0.129² + 0.4589²] ≈ √[0.065 + 0.0166 + 0.2105] ≈ √0.292 ≈ 0.54 → very close! So 11 and 16 are only 0.54 apart.\n\nSimilarly, 16 and 18: √[(20.3419 - 1.7446)² + (3.6801 - 3.4813)² + (46.8929 - 40.9732)²] ≈ √[18.5973² + 0.1988² + 5.9197²] ≈ √[345.86 + 0.0395 + 35.04] ≈ √380.94 ≈ 19.5 — still too far.\n\nBut 11 and 16 are 0.54 apart — so they are connected.\n\nNow 8 and 11: √[(3.2441 - 1.4896)² + (3.9729 - 3.3521)² + (47.8249 - 40.5143)²] ≈ √[1.7545² + 0.6208² + 7.3106²] ≈ √[3.078 + 0.385 + 53.44] ≈ √56.9 ≈ 7.54 — too far.\n\nSo 11 and 16 are connected (0.54), but 16 and 18 are not (19.5), so 16 is only connected to 11.\n\nSimilarly, 18 and 19: 2.7 apart — connected.\n\nSo we have:\n- Group A: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24 (all close to each other, < 3.0)\n- Group B: 11, 16 (connected)\n- Group C: 18, 19 (connected)\n- Others: 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 — all isolated (no one within 3.0 of them)\n\nWait — let's check if 3 and 6 are close: √[(9.6816 -
