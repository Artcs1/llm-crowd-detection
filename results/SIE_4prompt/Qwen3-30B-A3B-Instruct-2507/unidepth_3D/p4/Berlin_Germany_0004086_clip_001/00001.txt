The distances are calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nAfter computing all pairwise distances, I analyze their distribution to determine a reasonable threshold. The distances range from very small (e.g., between people 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24) to very large (e.g., between people near (0,0,0) and those near (37,5.5,36)). \n\nLooking at the data:\n- People 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 are all clustered near x ≈ -1.8 to -0.7, y ≈ 1.1–1.6, z ≈ 6.4–7.9 → very close together.\n- People 2, 4, 10, 15 are near x ≈ -0.7 to 0.0, y ≈ 0.8–1.2, z ≈ 3.0–3.4 → another tight cluster.\n- People 8, 11, 16 are around x ≈ 2.1–3.6, y ≈ 3.9–4.2, z ≈ 22–23 → a third cluster.\n- People 18, 19, 20, 21, 12, 13, 24 are scattered at higher x, y, z values (20–37), but with increasing separation. However, 18, 19, 20, 21 are close to each other (x ≈ 21–24, y ≈ 4.5–5.5, z ≈ 26–30), forming a group. 12 and 13 are further away and not close to others.\n\nI use a threshold of 1.5 meters based on the distribution: most close pairs (within clusters) are below 1.0 m, and the next closest pairs are above 2.0 m. Using 1.5 m ensures we capture tight groups without merging distant ones.\n\nThen, I apply transitive grouping:\n- All people within 1.5 m of each other (directly or indirectly) are grouped.\n- The clusters found are:\n  - Group 1: {1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24} — all within ~0.5 m of each other.\n  - Group 2: {2, 4, 10, 15} — tightly clustered near (0,1.1,3.2).\n  - Group 3: {8, 11, 16} — around (2.5,4.1,22.5).\n  - Group 4: {18, 19, 20, 21} — near (22–24, 5, 26–30).\n  - Group 5: {12, 13} — far apart from others, but 12 and 13 are ~1.5 m apart (x: 24.06 vs 35.47, y: 5.08 vs 5.50, z: 30.94 vs 36.40 → distance ≈ 11.6 m) — actually too far. Wait: recalculating 12 and 13:  \n    - dist(12,13) = sqrt((35.47-24.06)^2 + (5.50-5.08)^2 + (36.40-30.94)^2) ≈ sqrt(129.8 + 0.18 + 30.0) ≈ sqrt(159.98) ≈ 12.65 m — not close. So 12 and 13 are isolated and not close to anyone. But 12 is at (24.06,5.08,30.94), 18 at (21.70,4.52,26.04) → dist ≈ sqrt((2.36)^2 + (0.56)^2 + (4.9)^2) ≈ sqrt(5.57 + 0.31 + 24.01) ≈ sqrt(29.89) ≈ 5.47 m — too far. So 12 and 13 are isolated.\n\nBut wait: 12 and 13 are at (24.06,5.08,30.94) and (35.47,5.50,36.40) — clearly not close. So they are not in any group. Similarly, 3 is at (9.57,2.00,10.79), 6 at (9.17,2.60,13.65) — dist ≈ sqrt((0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (2.86)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.16+0.36+8.18) ≈ sqrt(8.7) ≈ 2.95 m — too far from others.\n\nSo only the four clusters are valid.\n\nBut wait: person 24 is at (-0.757, 1.195, 6.440), and person 1 is at (-2.50, 1.53, 6.36) → dist ≈ sqrt((1.74)^2 + (0.33)^2 + (0.08)^2) ≈ sqrt(3.03 + 0.11 + 0.006) ≈ sqrt(3.15) ≈ 1.78 m — above 1.5 m.

The distances range from very small (e.g., between people 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24) to very large (e.g., between people near (0,0,0) and those near (37,5.5,36)). \n\nLooking at the data:\n- People 1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24 are all clustered near x ≈ -1.8 to -0.7, y ≈ 1.1–1.6, z ≈ 6.4–7.9 → very close together.\n- People 2, 4, 10, 15 are near x ≈ -0.7 to 0.0, y ≈ 0.8–1.2, z ≈ 3.0–3.4 → another tight cluster.\n- People 8, 11, 16 are around x ≈ 2.1–3.6, y ≈ 3.9–4.2, z ≈ 22–23 → a third cluster.\n- People 18, 19, 20, 21, 12, 13, 24 are scattered at higher x, y, z values (20–37), but with increasing separation. However, 18, 19, 20, 21 are close to each other (x ≈ 21–24, y ≈ 4.5–5.5, z ≈ 26–30), forming a group. 12 and 13 are further away and not close to others.\n\nI use a threshold of 1.5 meters based on the distribution: most close pairs (within clusters) are below 1.0 m, and the next closest pairs are above 2.0 m. Using 1.5 m ensures we capture tight groups without merging distant ones.\n\nThen, I apply transitive grouping:\n- All people within 1.5 m of each other (directly or indirectly) are grouped.\n- The clusters found are:\n  - Group 1: {1, 5, 7, 14, 17, 24} — all within ~0.5 m of each other.\n  - Group 2: {2, 4, 10, 15} — tightly clustered near (0,1.1,3.2).\n  - Group 3: {8, 11, 16} — around (2.5,4.1,22.5).\n  - Group 4: {18, 19, 20, 21} — near (22–24, 5, 26–30).\n  - Group 5: {12, 13} — far apart from others, but 12 and 13 are ~1.5 m apart (x: 24.06 vs 35.47, y: 5.08 vs 5.50, z: 30.94 vs 36.40 → distance ≈ 11.6 m) — actually too far. Wait: recalculating 12 and 13:  \n    - dist(12,13) = sqrt((35.47-24.06)^2 + (5.50-5.08)^2 + (36.40-30.94)^2) ≈ sqrt(129.8 + 0.18 + 30.0) ≈ sqrt(159.98) ≈ 12.65 m — not close. So 12 and 13 are isolated and not close to anyone. But 12 is at (24.06,5.08,30.94), 18 at (21.70,4.52,26.04) → dist ≈ sqrt((2.36)^2 + (0.56)^2 + (4.9)^2) ≈ sqrt(5.57 + 0.31 + 24.01) ≈ sqrt(29.89) ≈ 5.47 m — too far. So 12 and 13 are isolated.\n\nBut wait: 12 and 13 are at (24.06,5.08,30.94) and (35.47,5.50,36.40) — clearly not close. So they are not in any group. Similarly, 3 is at (9.57,2.00,10.79), 6 at (9.17,2.60,13.65) — dist ≈ sqrt((0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (2.86)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.16+0.36+8.18) ≈ sqrt(8.7) ≈ 2.95 m — too far from others.\n\nSo only the four clusters are valid.\n\nBut wait: person 24 is at (-0.757, 1.195, 6.440), and person 1 is at (-2.50, 1.53, 6.36) → dist ≈ sqrt((1.74)^2 + (0.33)^2 + (0.08)^2) ≈ sqrt(3.03 + 0.11 + 0.006) ≈ sqrt(3.15) ≈ 1.78 m — above 1.5 m. But 1 and 5:  \n- 1: (-2.50,1.53,6.36), 5: (-1.83,1.58,6.59) → dx=0.67, dy=0.05, dz=0.23 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.45 + 0.0025 + 0.053) ≈ sqrt(0.505) ≈ 0.71 m  \n- 5 and 7: 5 (-1.83,1.58,6.59), 7 (-1.76,1.22,7.84) → dx=0.07, dy=0.36, dz=1.25 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.0049 + 0.1296 + 1.5625) ≈ sqrt(1.7) ≈ 1.30 m  \n- 7 and 14: 7 (-1.76,1.22,7.84), 14 (-1.77,1.24,7.86) → dx=0.01, dy=0.02, dz=0.02 → dist ≈ 0.03 m  \n- 14 and 17: 14 (-1.77,1.24,7.86), 17 (-1.76,1.22,7.83) → dx=0.01, dy=0.02, dz=0.03 → dist ≈ 0.035 m  \n- 17 and 24: 17 (-1.76,1.22,7.83), 24 (-0.757,1.195,6.44) → dx=1.003, dy=0.025, dz=1.39 → dist ≈ sqrt(1.006 + 0.0006 + 1.932) ≈ sqrt(2.94) ≈ 1.72 m — too high.\n\nSo 24 is not close to 17. But 24 and 1: dist ≈ 1.78 m — also above 1.5. But 24 and 9: 9 (-0.7575,1.1875,6.4426), 24 (-0.7572,1.1945,6.4401) → dx=0.0003, dy=0.007, dz=0.0025 → dist ≈ 0.007 m — very close.\n\nSo 9 and 24 are extremely close. 9 and 5: 5 (-1.83,1.58,6.59), 9 (-0.7575,1.1875,6.4426) → dx=1.07, dy=0.39, dz=0.147 → dist ≈ sqrt(1.14 + 0.15 + 0.022) ≈ sqrt(1.31) ≈ 1.14 m — below 1.5.\n\nSo 5 and 9 are within 1.5 m. 9 and 24 are within 0.01 m. So 5, 9, 24 are connected.\n\nBut 5 and 1: 0.71 m → connected. So 1, 5, 9, 24 are all connected.\n\nNow 7: 7 (-1.76,1.22,7.84), 5 (-1.83,1.58,6.59) → dist ≈ 1.30 m — below 1.5 → connected.\n\nSo 1,5,7,9,24 are all connected.\n\nNow 14 and 17: very close (0.035 m), and 14 and 7: 1.30 m — so 7 and 14 are connected → so 1,5,7,9,14,17,24 are all in one group.\n\n17 and 24: 1.72 m — above 1.5 → not directly connected, but through 7 and 14.\n\nSo yes, all 7 people (1,5,7,9,14,17,24) are connected via chains of distances < 1.5 m.\n\nNow check 2,4,10,15:  \n- 2 and 4: (-0.51,1.17,3.08) and (0.04,1.19,3.36) → dx=0.55, dy=0.02, dz=0.28 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.30 + 0.0004 + 0.078) ≈ sqrt(0.378) ≈ 0.615 m  \n- 4 and 10: 4 (-0.51,1.17,3.08), 10 (-0.38,0.81,3.23) → dx=0.13, dy=0.36, dz=0.15 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.0169 + 0.1296 + 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.169) ≈ 0.41 m  \n- 10 and 15: 10 (-0.38,0.81,3.23), 15 (-0.77,0.92,3.27) → dx=0.39, dy=0.11, dz=0.04 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.152 + 0.012 + 0.0016) ≈ sqrt(0.1656) ≈ 0.407 m  \n- 2 and 15: 2 (0.04,1.19,3.36), 15 (-0.77,0.92,3.27) → dx=0.81, dy=0.27, dz=0.09 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.656 + 0.073 + 0.008) ≈ sqrt(0.737) ≈ 0.86 m — below 1.5\n\nSo all 4 are connected.\n\nNow 8,11,16:  \n- 8 (3.61,4.22,23.33), 11 (2.15,3.89,22.23) → dx=1.46, dy=0.33, dz=1.10 → dist ≈ sqrt(2.13 + 0.11 + 1.21) ≈ sqrt(3.45) ≈ 1.86 m — above 1.5  \n- 11 and 16: 11 (2.15,3.89,22.23), 16 (2.52,4.19,23.16) → dx=0.37, dy=0.30, dz=0.93 → dist ≈ sqrt(0.137 + 0.09 + 0.865) ≈ sqrt(1.092) ≈ 1.045 m  \n- 8 and 16: 8 (3.61,4.22,23.33), 16 (2.52,4.19,23.16) → dx=1.09, dy=0.03, dz=0.17 → dist ≈ sqrt(1.188 + 0.0009 + 0.0289) ≈ sqrt(1.218) ≈ 1.10 m\n\nSo 8–16: 1.10 m < 1.5 → connected  \n16–11: 1.045 m < 1.5 → connected  \nBut 8–11: 1.86 m > 1.5 → not directly, but through 16 → so all three are connected.\n\nNow 18,19,20,21:  \n- 18 (21.70,4.52,26.04), 19 (24.33,5.03,30.66) → dx=2.63, dy=0.51, dz=4.62 → dist ≈ sqrt(6.92 + 0.26 + 21.34) ≈ sqrt(28.52) ≈ 5.34 m — too far  \n- 19 and 20: 19 (24.33,5.03,30.66), 20 (37.19,5.54,36.65) → dx=12.86, dy=0.51, dz=5.99 → dist ≈ sqrt(165.4 + 0.26 + 35.88) ≈ sqrt(201.54) ≈ 14.2 m  \n- 18 and 20: even farther  \n- 21 (17.93,5.49,32.50), 18 (21.70,4.52,26.04) → dx=3.77, dy=0.97, dz=6.46 → dist ≈ sqrt(14.2 + 0.94 + 41.7) ≈ sqrt(56.84) ≈ 7.54 m  \n- 21 and 19: 19 (24.33,5.03,30.66), 21 (17.93,5.49,32.50) → dx=6.4, dy=0.46, dz=1.84 → dist ≈ sqrt(41.0 + 0.21 + 3.39) ≈ sqrt(44.6) ≈ 6.68 m  \n- 18 and 21: 7.54 m\n\nNo pair within 1.5 m.
